# Facial Recognition in the Real World
---
## Facial recognition technology in mobile devices
Facial recognition technology has become increasingly common in mobile devices, allowing users to unlock their phones and access various features or applications using facial biometrics. While facial recognition can offer convenience, it also raises important data protection and privacy considerations. Here are some key points to consider regarding facial recognition on mobile phones and data protection:

* **Biometric Data Privacy**: Facial recognition involves the collection and storage of biometric data, which is highly sensitive personal information. Biometric data, including facial features, is unique to individuals and, if mishandled, can have severe privacy implications.
* **Regulations and Laws**: Many countries and regions have introduced regulations and laws governing the use of biometric data, including facial recognition. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) impose strict requirements on the collection, processing, and storage of biometric data. 
* **Informed Consent**: Users should be provided with clear and transparent information about how their facial biometric data will be collected, stored, and used. Obtaining informed consent is a fundamental requirement for processing biometric data.
* **Data Security**: Mobile devices that use facial recognition must have robust security measures in place to protect the biometric data from unauthorized access or breaches. Encryption and secure storage of biometric templates are essential.
* **User Control**: Users should have the ability to opt in or opt out of using facial recognition on their devices. Additionally, they should be able to delete their biometric data if they choose to do so.
* **Data Localization**: Depending on regional laws, there may be requirements to store biometric data locally rather than transmitting it to servers located in other countries. Compliance with these regulations is critical.
* **Accuracy and Bias**: Facial recognition systems must be accurate and should not exhibit bias, particularly with regard to gender, age, or race. Biased systems can lead to discrimination and privacy violations.
* **Data Retention**: Clear policies should be in place regarding how long facial biometric data will be retained. Data should not be kept longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.
* **Third-Party Apps**: Mobile app developers should follow best practices for biometric data protection when incorporating facial recognition into their applications. They should also obtain user consent for biometric data access.
* **Legal Rights**: Individuals should be aware of their legal rights concerning their biometric data. They may have the right to access, correct, or delete their data under relevant privacy laws.
* **Vendor Trustworthiness**: When choosing a mobile device, users should consider the trustworthiness of the vendor and whether they have a history of respecting user privacy and security.
* **Biometric Alternatives**: Some individuals may choose to use other authentication methods, such as PINs or passwords, if they have concerns about the use of facial recognition technology.

In summary, while facial recognition on mobile phones can offer convenience, it should be implemented with strict adherence to data protection and privacy regulations. Users should be informed about how their biometric data is handled, and vendors should prioritize security and user privacy in the development of facial recognition systems.

## Opting out of face recognition requires vigilance.
Privacy concerns surrounding the use of facial recognition technology at airports have sparked a growing demand for answers and the right to opt out. Passengers and privacy advocates alike are seeking clarity from government agencies and airlines about the handling of their biometric data and the option to decline facial recognition.

While the questions raised should have straightforward answers, obtaining information from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and airlines has proven challenging. In response to inquiries, CBP directed individuals to visit their website, which left many questions unanswered. The lack of transparency has fueled passenger frustration.

Currently, opting out of face recognition requires vigilance. There is no single checkbox to decline, and it may not be available to non-U.S. persons. Travelers must be observant and recognize when their biometric data is being scanned, which can happen during TSA PreCheck, Clear, or other expedited processes.

Face recognition is primarily implemented at specific airports and on particular airlines, especially for international flights. However, the scope may expand in the future. The lack of clear procedures for opting out has left passengers concerned about privacy invasion.

The confusion arises because different entities, including airlines, CBP, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), are utilizing facial recognition for various purposes. Airlines aim to use facial recognition as a boarding pass, CBP seeks to check travelers against government databases for entry and exit verification, and TSA intends to compare faces with photo identification throughout the airport. Passengers are increasingly aware of the invasive nature of these systems, and their concerns are growing.

The government agencies' rapid implementation of facial recognition and biometric data collection without clear regulations is alarming. The lack of transparency and potential security risks associated with massive biometric databases are causing passengers to bear the burden of privacy invasion. Inaccuracies and biases in these systems further exacerbate concerns, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities.

Efforts to pause these programs and demand transparency and privacy safeguards are underway, with passengers and lawmakers advocating for stricter regulations. The battle to protect privacy rights in the age of facial recognition technology continues, emphasizing the need for clear procedures, accountability, and regulation before these systems become deeply entrenched in everyday life.

## The need to regulate and restrict facial recognition technology in airport security is essential to privacy
The use of facial recognition technology at airports has raised concerns about privacy and surveillance, leading passengers to demand answers and the option to opt out. Questions about data protection, airport locations using this technology, and the opt-out process have been met with limited responses from government agencies and airlines. Currently, there is no straightforward opt-out method, making vigilance crucial for those concerned about their privacy.

Facial recognition is primarily implemented at specific airports and on certain airlines, with the potential for expansion to more locations. However, the lack of regulations on this technology raises significant privacy and security issues. Travelers are urged to be cautious when asked to participate in biometric identification, as errors in the system can lead to misidentification and potential delays.

There are multiple face recognition checkpoints at airports, including airlines using faces as boarding passes, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) checking identities against databases, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) comparing faces to photo identification throughout the airport. CBP and TSA aim to implement biometric tracking from check-in to flights, and rapid expansion plans are underway. The collection of biometric data, including fingerprints, facial images, and iris scans, is a growing concern as it can be stored for extended periods and used for various checks, including immigration and law enforcement.

The burden of privacy invasion and the consequences of inaccuracies in facial recognition systems will ultimately fall on passengers, not airlines or government agencies. Security and privacy risks associated with vast biometric databases are considerable, with leaked biometric data being far more damaging than traditional data breaches. Additionally, these systems are known for their inaccuracy, disproportionately affecting people of color, women, and young individuals.

Efforts to regulate and restrict facial recognition technology are essential to protect privacy rights. Congress must demand answers to critical questions about data safeguarding, opt-out procedures, and the technology's accuracy. The time for action is now, as we work to ensure that privacy remains a fundamental right in the face of advancing facial recognition technology.

## A warrant is required for searches of cell phones at the border
A historic decision in United States v. Smith, a case in the Southern District of New York, has ruled that a warrant is required for searches of cell phones at the border, except in cases of exigent circumstances. This ruling marks a significant victory for privacy rights at the border.

The U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP) has claimed broad authority to conduct warrantless and often suspicionless searches of electronic devices at the border, including ports of entry at land borders, international airports, and seaports. However, this decision challenges that authority.

The Supreme Court has long recognized a border search exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, allowing for warrantless and often suspicionless searches of luggage and other items crossing the border. Yet, this decision suggests that electronic devices, like cell phones, deserve different treatment due to their capacity to store vast amounts of sensitive information.

The number of warrantless device searches at the border has been on the rise, with CBP conducting a record-high 45,499 device searches in Fiscal Year 2022.

Federal appellate courts have taken steps to limit CBP's authority in this area. The Ninth Circuit and Fourth Circuit have previously ruled that a warrant is required for device searches at the border in certain situations, citing the Supreme Court's decision in Riley v. California (2014). Riley established that a warrant is needed to search an arrestee's cell phone.

The Smith court applied the Riley balancing test, weighing the government's interests in warrantless and suspicionless device searches against travelers' privacy interests. The court emphasized that modern cell phones contain a vast amount of sensitive information, and travelers should not be expected to forfeit their privacy by carrying a cell phone.

The court also noted that the government's interests in searching cell phone data at the border are relatively weak compared to their interests in searching physical items. Unlike physical items, data on a cell phone often exists on remote servers within the country, making it less susceptible to being blocked at the border.

The decision aligns closely with arguments made by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and cites the Ninth Circuit's United States v. Cano case, in which EFF submitted an amicus brief. The court praised the Ninth Circuit for its engagement with EFF's arguments, even though it did not go as far as requiring a warrant in all cases.

EFF sees this decision as a significant step in protecting personal privacy at the border and hopes that other courts, including the Second Circuit and possibly the Supreme Court, will follow suit.

## Significant changes to the collection and use of biometrics in the enforcement and administration of immigration laws in the United States
This proposed rule, published by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), outlines significant changes related to the collection and use of biometrics in the enforcement and administration of immigration laws in the United States. The key points of the proposed rule are as follows:

1. **Mandatory Biometrics Collection:** The rule suggests that anyone involved in immigration benefits or requests, including U.S. citizens, will be required to undergo biometrics collection. This requirement applies regardless of age, with certain exceptions that may be determined by DHS.
2. **Biometrics Upon Arrest:** The proposed rule allows for the collection of biometrics, irrespective of age, when an individual is arrested for immigration-related purposes. This is aimed at streamlining processing, care, custody, and the initiation of removal proceedings.
3. **Definition of Biometrics:** The rule seeks to provide a clear definition of the term "biometrics."
4. **Expanded Biometric Modalities:** The proposal suggests expanding the types of biometric data collected to include iris images, palm prints, and voice prints.
5. **DNA Testing:** DHS may require, request, or accept DNA test results, including partial DNA profiles, to verify claimed genetic relationships. DNA test results may also be used for various immigration and naturalization processes.
6. **Moral Character and Age Considerations:** Changes to the way individuals demonstrate good moral character, especially related to the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and T nonimmigrant petitioners, are proposed. Additionally, the presumption of good moral character for those under the age of 14 may be removed.
7. **Expanded Use of Biometrics:** The rule aims to clarify the purposes for which biometrics are collected, which include criminal history and national security background checks, identity verification, secure document production, and administration and enforcement of immigration and naturalization laws.

The proposed changes are intended to provide greater flexibility in adapting biometrics collection practices, enhance identity verification in the immigration process, reduce reliance on paper documentation, prevent identity fraud, and standardize biometrics terminology across DHS. 

The rule is open for public comments until October 13, 2020, and the public is encouraged to submit feedback through the Federal eRulemaking Portal.
